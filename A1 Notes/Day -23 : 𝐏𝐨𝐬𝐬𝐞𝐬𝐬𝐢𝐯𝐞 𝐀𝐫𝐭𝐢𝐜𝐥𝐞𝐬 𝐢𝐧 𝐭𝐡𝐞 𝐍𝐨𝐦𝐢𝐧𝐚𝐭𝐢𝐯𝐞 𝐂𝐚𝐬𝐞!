We've covered nouns, genders. Now, let's talk about ownership! Today, we're diving into possessive articles – those little words like "my," "your," "his," "her," etc., that tell us whose something is. We'll focus specifically on their use in the Nominative case.

In German, possessive articles (or possessive pronouns, as they function similarly) show ownership and change their endings based on the gender and number of the noun they accompany. When they are in the Nominative case, they act as the subject of the sentence or describe the subject. It's a bit like "ein" and "eine" for "a/an," but for possession!

- Starting with "Mein" (My):
Examples for "mein":
Das ist mein Fernseher. (This is my television.)
Das ist mein Auto. (This is my car.)
Das ist meine Katze. (This is my cat.)
Das sind meine Bücher. (These are my books.)

- For "du" (you - informal singular), we use "dein / deine":
Ist das dein Buch? (Is that your book?)
Ist das deine Katze? (Is that your cat?)

- For "Sie" (You - formal singular/plural) or "sie" (they), we use "Ihr / Ihre":
Guten Tag, wie ist Ihr Name? (Good day, what is your name?)
Mein Name ist Maria. (My name is Maria.)
Ist das Ihr Fernseher? (Is that your television?)
Sind das Ihre Bücher? (Are those your books?)

- For "wir" (we), we use "unser / unsere":
Wir sind eine Familie. (We are a family.)
Das ist unser Fernseher. (That is our television.)
Das sind unsere Bücher. (Those are our books.)

- For "ihr" (you - informal plural), we use "euer / eure":
Wie heißt ihr? Woher kommt ihr? (What are your names? Where do you come from?)
Ist das euer Auto? (Is that your car?)
Sind das eure Bücher? (Are those your books?)

✍️ Practice Tip:
Look around you! Pick a few objects and try to say "This is my..." or "Is that your...?" in German, remembering to adjust the possessive article based on the noun's gender. 

For example, if you see a table (der Tisch), you'd say "Das ist mein Tisch." If it's a lamp (die Lampe), "Das ist meine Lampe."
