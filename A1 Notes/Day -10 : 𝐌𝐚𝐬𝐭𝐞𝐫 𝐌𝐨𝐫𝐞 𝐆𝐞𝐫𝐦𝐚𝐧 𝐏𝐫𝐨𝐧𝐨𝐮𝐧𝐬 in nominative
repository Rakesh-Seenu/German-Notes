Ready for more German fun? Today, we're diving deeper into those handy personal pronouns that help you sound more natural and avoid repetition! ✨ Let's see them in action, just like on our blackboard! 👇

🤔 What are Pronouns? Pronouns are like shortcuts! They replace nouns to make your sentences smoother and shorter.

Meet "Wir" (We)! 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 See how "wir" helps us talk about more than one person:

- Ich wohne in New York. (I live in New York.)
- Wir wohnen in New York. (We live in New York.)
- Ich heiße Maria. Ich komme aus Spanien. Ich habe ein Kind. Wir wohnen in Berlin. (I am called Maria. I come from Spain. I have a child. We live in Berlin.)
👉 Your turn! Where do you and your friends live? "Wir wohnen in..."

Say Hello to "Ihr" (You all - Informal)! 👋 When you're talking to a group of friends, "ihr" is your go-to!
- Max, wo wohnst du? (Max, where do you live?)
- Julia und Peter, wo wohnt ihr? (Julia and Peter, where do you live?)
👉 Try it! If you're asking your classmates where they live: "Wo wohnt ihr?"

Discover "Sie" (She) and "Sie" (They)! 💁‍♀️👫 These are super useful for talking about people!
- Das ist Michaela. (This is Michaela.)
- Sie wohnt in Paris. (She lives in Paris.)
- Das sind Petra und Jürgen. (These are Petra and Jürgen.)
- Sie wohnen in Hamburg. (They live in Hamburg.)
👉 Can you describe someone you know using "Sie wohnt in..."?
