we tackled the Akkusativ case itself, learning how direct objects make articles change, especially for masculine nouns. Today, we're building right on that foundation by looking at how our possessive articles ("my," "your," "his," etc.) behave in the Akkusativ!

The good news is, the rule we learned yesterday about the Akkusativ case mostly affecting masculine nouns carries over directly to possessive articles!
Let's look at the "At a glance" table from the lesson:

The masculine column ends with -en (e.g., meinen, deinen, seinen). All the other forms (feminine, neuter, plural) are exactly the same as they were in the Nominativ case! This is super helpful because it means less memorization for those other genders.

𝐋𝐞𝐭'𝐬 𝐒𝐞𝐞 𝐒𝐨𝐦𝐞 𝐄𝐱𝐚𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞𝐬! :

The lesson provided some fantastic examples that really drive this home.
1. "Ich liebe meinen Mann." (I love my husband.)
In the Nominativ, it's "Das ist mein Mann."
But when "Mann" (masculine) becomes the direct object of "lieben" (to love), "mein" changes to "meinen."
2. "Ich liebe mein Auto." (I love my car.)
Here, "Auto" is neuter ("das Auto"), so the possessive article "mein" stays "mein" even in the Akkusativ. No change!
3. "Ich liebe meine Kinder." (I love my children.)
"Kinder" is plural ("die Kinder"), so "meine" also stays "meine" in the Akkusativ.
4. "Er mag seinen Hund." (He likes his dog.)
"Hund" is masculine ("der Hund"). When he likes the dog (direct object), "sein" becomes "seinen."
5. "Er mag seine Freundin." (He likes his girlfriend.)
"Freundin" is feminine ("die Freundin"), so "seine" stays "seine."
6. "Sie findet ihre Nachbarn freundlich." (She finds her neighbors friendly.)
"Nachbarn" (neighbors) is plural, so "ihre" remains "ihre" in the Akkusativ.

✍️ 𝐏𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐜𝐞 𝐓𝐢𝐩:
When you're trying to figure out which form of the possessive article to use, always ask yourself two questions:
What is the gender of the noun?
Is the noun the direct object of the verb? (Is it receiving the action?)
If the answer to both is "masculine" and "yes," then you know you need that -en ending! Keep practicing, and it will start to feel much more natural.
